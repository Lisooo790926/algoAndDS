// the key is giving your reason! 

//If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:
BFS 

//If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare: 
DFS  
// DFS will take long, because tree is so deep
// take so long to finish one branch (we are using recursive)
-> BFS

//If the tree is very wide:
DFS 
memorySaving (BFS will take too much memory)

//If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree:
DFS 

//Determining whether a path exists between two nodes:
DFS

//Finding the shortest path:
BFS
